inkscape-scad-lsystems
======================

Summary
-------
Inkscape, the free vector drawing tool, has a tool for generating L-systems in it.  I've been playing around with it generate some of the classic shapes.  In each directory, I've added the set of parameters necessary to input into the tool and some example files that are generated.

Examples
--------
